# ToolRec-Code
The source code of the paper "Let Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning".

This project builds upon the powerful attribute-based retrieval capabilities of [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole), a comprehensive, flexible, and easy-to-use recommendation algorithm library. Furthermore, the User Decision Simulation module integrates the [ReAct pipeline](https://react-lm.github.io/), enhancing the system's decision-making processes.
